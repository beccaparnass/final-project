    <p>Boy bands have always been popular. From NSYNC to One Direction, there have been countless boy bands throughout
        the years. One of those bands is the Australian boy band 5 Seconds of Summer, or 5SOS. 5SOS burst onto the scene
        in 2014 with their popular single: “She Looks So Perfect.” The song played over the radio constantly, the catchy
        tune and lyrics cementing 5SOS’s teen heartthrob status.</p>
    <p>5SOS released two albums, their 2014 self-titled debut, and 2015’s <i>Sounds Good Feels Good</i>, before taking a
        three-year hiatus. When they returned, it was for their third studio album: <i>Youngblood</i>, a complete
        deviation from their previous work. 5SOS had grown up, and their music had grown up with them. Their sound,
        looks and lyrics had all matured.</p>
        <img src="unnamed.jpg" class="img-fluid">
    <p>Why Don’t We, or WDW, another popular boy band, underwent a similar transformation. WDW formed in 2016 and
        released their first album in 2018, titled <i>8 Letters</i>. <i>8 Letters</i> was filled with fun and flirty
        numbers about love and growing up. WDW’s second album, <i>The Good Times And The Bad Ones</i>, was released in
        2021, and was a complete reinvention of the band. The album was the first written and produced entirely on their
        own, reinventing both WDW’s sound and aesthetic, mirroring their transition from teenagers to adults.

    <!-- </div> -->
    <p>5SOS and WDW have massive fan bases, mostly hordes of screaming teenagers with homemade signs made with fervor
        and glitter. These fans are loyal, and have followed the bands since the beginning. As 5SOS and WDW changed
        their sound to match their maturity, did this affect their sales and status?</p>
    <h2>LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA:</h2>
    <!-- <div class="container2"> -->
    <img src="Untitled design.jpg" class="img-fluid">
    <!-- </div> -->
    <p>This chart illustrates 5SOS's album sales from 2014-2022. The band's debut album, <i>5 Seconds of Summer</i>,
        released in 2014, sold 734,000 copies in the United States. 2015's <i>Sounds Good Feels Good</i> sold 496,000
        copies in the US. <i>Youngblood</i>, released in 2018, sold 700,000 copies in the US. <i>Calm</i>, released in
        2020, sold 113,000 copies in the US. <i>5SOS5</i>, released in 2022, sold 36,000 copies in the US. Fans seemed
        to like the change in sound for <i>Youngblood</i>, as this album sold nearly as many copies as 5SOS's debut
        album. However, there is a steady decline in sales for <i>Calm</i> and <i>5SOS5</i>.</p>
    <!-- <div class="container3"> -->
        <img src="Your paragraph text.jpg" class="img-fluid">
    <!-- </div> -->
    <p>The above chart illustrates WDW’s album sales. 2018's <i> 8 Letters </i> sold 37,000 copies while 2021's <i> The
            Good Times and the Bad Ones </i> sold 38,000 copies. There isn't much of a difference, however <i> The Good
            Times and the Bad Ones </i> did sell an additional 1000 copies.</p>
    <p>5SOS has had many songs chart on Billboard's Hot 100 List. Their highest charting song was "Youngblood," the
        title track of their third album <i>Youngblood</i>. The second highest charted song was "Amnesia," from their
        debut album. This shows their fans have remained loyal, even as the band underwent a transformation.</p>
    <!-- <div class="container4"> -->

    <!-- </div> -->
    <p>Why Don't We has only ever had one song chart on the Billboard Hot 100 list, and that was "Fallin'," from their
        second album <i>The Good Times and the Bad Ones</i>. None of the songs from <i>8 Letters</i> charted on the
        Billboard Hot 100.</p>
    <!-- <div class="container5"> -->
        <img src="WDW Hot 100.png" class="img-fluid">
    <!-- </div> -->
    <p>All five of 5SOS’s full-length studio albums have hit No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales, however only four are
        pictured in the image below. <i>The Good Times and the Bad Ones</i> made No. 1, while 8 Letters hit No. 3 on the
        list.</p>

        <p>What do we make of all this? Both 5SOS and WDW managed to survive the unthinkable: growing up in the public eye.
        Their music developed, and they matured as individuals, and as artists. Seemingly—their popularity grew with
        them.</p>
